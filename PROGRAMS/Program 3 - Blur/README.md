Program 3

Mostly good, but OpenGL was being annoying and not letting me pass a uniform int to the compute shader to specify the direction of the blur so I had to make a second shader entirely for each pass. Having blur in both directions makes it look bad, so press N to toggle between good looking horizontal blur and bad looking two pass blur, IDK why but oh well
